# Chess-Titans: ‚ôüÔ∏èüè∞ A 3D Chess Game with Parallax Effects üååüåü

## About the Project

Chess-Titans is a unique and visually captivating chess game that I developed for a hackathon project. The inspiration behind this project came from my passion for chess ‚ôüÔ∏èü§© and my desire to create a modern and immersive chess experience for players of all skill levels. I wanted to combine my knowledge of web development (HTML, CSS, JS, SCSS) with 3D effects and parallax scrolling to make a visually stunning and interactive chess game.

## Problem Statement

The objective of the project was to create a fully functional and visually appealing chess game with the following features:

1. **Chess Gameplay**: Implement the core chess logic to allow players to move pieces, check for valid moves, and implement game-ending conditions (checkmate, stalemate).

2. **VS Human and VS CPU Modes**: Provide options for players to choose between playing against another human player or challenging an AI-based CPU opponent with varying difficulty levels.

3. **Login Page**: Design a secure login page where users can create accounts, log in, and save their gameplay progress.

4. **Official Website**: Develop an official website for the Chess-Titans game where users can learn about the game, access the login page, and download the game if needed.

5. **3D Chess Board Modal**: Create a visually stunning 3D chessboard modal with realistic animations and intuitive controls.

6. **Parallax Effects**: Implement parallax scrolling effects on the website to enhance user engagement and provide a captivating visual experience.

## My Contribution

### Chess Logic and Game Development

I started by building the core chess logic in JavaScript. This involved defining the rules for each chess piece, validating moves, checking for checkmate and stalemate conditions, and handling the game state. I also created the necessary HTML and CSS structure for the chessboard and pieces.

### VS Human and VS CPU Modes

For the VS Human mode, I implemented the functionality to enable two players to make moves alternately by using event listeners and handling user input.

For the VS CPU mode, I integrated a chess engine based on the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. I fine-tuned the algorithm's depth to control the difficulty level of the CPU opponent, allowing players to choose between easy, medium, and hard difficulty settings.

### Login Page and User Authentication

I designed a sleek and secure login page using HTML and CSS. To handle user authentication, I utilized JavaScript to manage user accounts, store data securely, and allow users to save their progress and access it later. I also implemented encryption techniques to ensure data privacy.

### Official Website

For the official website, I used HTML, CSS, and SCSS to create an attractive and user-friendly interface. The website showcased the game's features, displayed screenshots, and provided a download link to the game.

### 3D Chess Board Modal and Parallax Effects

The most exciting part of the project was creating the 3D chessboard modal with parallax effects. I utilized Three.js, a popular JavaScript library for 3D rendering, to build the 3D chessboard. I added smooth animations to chess piece movements and integrated parallax effects on the website to enhance the overall visual appeal.

## Challenges Faced

1. **Chess Logic Complexity**: Implementing the intricate rules of chess and ensuring all moves were correctly validated required careful planning and rigorous testing.

2. **AI Development**: Designing and fine-tuning the AI algorithm to provide a challenging but beatable CPU opponent was a challenging task. Balancing difficulty levels was crucial to offer an enjoyable experience for players of varying skill levels.

3. **3D Chessboard and Parallax Integration**: Learning and implementing Three.js to create a realistic 3D chessboard with smooth animations was challenging. Additionally, incorporating parallax effects on the website without negatively impacting performance required optimization.

4. **User Authentication and Data Security**: Ensuring user data privacy and implementing secure authentication mechanisms demanded meticulous attention to detail.

## What I Learned

Developing Chess-Titans was an incredible learning experience. I honed my skills in web development, gained proficiency in JavaScript, and deepened my understanding of CSS, SCSS, and 3D rendering with Three.js. I also gained valuable insights into AI algorithms and user authentication techniques.








## Inspiration üéØ

The inspiration for Chess-Titans came from my deep passion for chess ‚ôüÔ∏è and my love for modern web technologies. I wanted to create a chess game that not only showcased the timeless elegance of the game but also pushed the boundaries of what could be achieved with web development. The idea of combining 3D effects, parallax scrolling, and a powerful AI opponent ignited my creativity and drove me to create Chess-Titans.

## What it does üïπÔ∏è

Chess-Titans is a feature-rich chess game that offers two gameplay modes: VS Human and VS CPU. In VS Human mode, players can compete against each other on a visually stunning 3D chessboard. Alternatively, in VS CPU mode, they can challenge an AI-based CPU opponent with adjustable difficulty levels.

The game also includes a secure login page that allows users to create accounts, log in, and save their gameplay progress. Additionally, an official website showcases the game's features, provides download options, and delivers a captivating experience through parallax effects.

## How we built it üõ†Ô∏è

We built Chess-Titans using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SCSS for the frontend. For the 3D chessboard, we employed the powerful Three.js library to create a realistic and visually appealing game environment. The AI opponent was implemented using the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to provide challenging gameplay.

The login page and user authentication were designed to ensure data security and privacy. We utilized encryption techniques to safeguard user data and enable seamless account management.

## Challenges we ran into üöß

Building Chess-Titans came with its share of challenges. Implementing the intricate chess logic to handle valid moves, checkmate conditions, and stalemates required careful planning and extensive testing.

Integrating the AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels was a significant challenge. Fine-tuning the algorithm to strike the right balance between challenging and beatable AI opponents demanded iterative optimization.

Creating the 3D chessboard modal with smooth animations and parallax effects was both thrilling and technically demanding. Ensuring optimal performance while rendering the 3D environment and handling user interactions added an extra layer of complexity.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üèÜ

We are immensely proud of successfully developing Chess-Titans, a visually captivating and interactive chess game that brings the joy of chess to players worldwide. Our achievement lies not only in building the game but also in combining cutting-edge web technologies with a classic board game to create a unique and immersive experience.

The seamless integration of a secure login page and user authentication features ensures that players can enjoy the game while having their progress and achievements safely stored.

## What we learned üìö

Throughout the development of Chess-Titans, we deepened our knowledge of web development, JavaScript, CSS, and SCSS. The implementation of the AI opponent using the minimax algorithm enhanced our understanding of game theory and artificial intelligence.

Working with Three.js to build the 3D chessboard exposed us to the world of 3D rendering and animation in web development. We gained valuable insights into optimizing performance in WebGL applications.

Moreover, the project taught us the significance of meticulous planning, problem-solving, and the joy of creating a project that reflects our passion for both chess and web development.
