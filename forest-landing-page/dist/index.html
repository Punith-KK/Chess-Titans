        <h2>3D Chess Game: A Modern Twist on a Classic</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the 3D Chess Game, a modern twist on the classic strategy
          board game. Immerse yourself in a three-dimensional chessboard, adding
          depth and excitement to your gameplay experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Rules:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each player starts with 16 pieces, including:</li>
          <li>1 King</li>
          <li>1 Queen</li>
          <li>2 Rooks</li>
          <li>2 Knights</li>
          <li>2 Bishops</li>
          <li>8 Pawns</li>
          <li>White always moves first.</li>
          <li>Players take turns to move their pieces.</li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Capture your opponent's pieces by moving your piece to their
            position.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            The game ends when a player's King is under immediate attack
            (Check).
          </li>
          <li>
            If a player's King is in Check and cannot move out of it or capture
            the attacking piece, it's a Checkmate, and the game is over.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pawns can promote to Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight upon reaching
            the opposite end of the board.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />

          excitement of challenging your opponent in a new dimension!

        <h3>Fun Chess Facts</h3>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            Chess is one of the oldest known board games still played to this
            day, with origins dating back to the 6th century in India.
          </li>
          <li>
            The word "checkmate" comes from the Persian phrase "Shah Mat," which
            means "the King is defeated" or "the King is dead."
          </li>
          <li>
            Chess is recognized as a sport and is played competitively at local,
            national, and international levels.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are more possible moves in a game of chess than there are
            atoms in the observable universe, making it an incredibly complex
            game.
          </li>
          <li>
            The longest chess game ever recorded had 269 moves and ended in a
            draw.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chess is known for its strategic depth, requiring players to think
            multiple moves ahead and anticipate their opponent's strategies.
          </li>
        </ul>
